### Discriminator
For the discriminator, we used PatchGAN just like the discriminator in pix2pix.The network
keeps the training as stabilized as possible compared to other experimented
architectures.The name of the discriminator is self-explanatory meaning that the network
classifies real or fake based on custom sized patches.
